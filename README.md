# Plover Sound

Very early in development, but it's coming along nicely! Let me know in the plover discord if you have any suggestions: **@ricecakes808**

## Installation

There are 3 modes you can use, `sample`, `mapped`, and `melody`. Set your preferred mode at the top of the file, adjust settings as needed and then install!

You have to git clone and then install manually from the command line. See the instructions [here](https://plover.wiki/index.php/Plugins).
